# Visual_Search

An interactive Path Finding Game built with Pygame, where users can explore and visualize various pathfinding algorithms. With custom background music, sound effects, and an easy-to-use interface, this game is a great tool to learn about how pathfinding algorithms work and compare their efficiency in real-time.

## Features

- **Algorithms Implemented**:
  - A* (A-star)
  - BFS (Breadth-First Search)
  - DFS (Depth-First Search)
  - UCS (Uniform Cost Search)
  - Dijkstra's Algorithm

- **Audio Experience**:
  - Custom background music for different game stages:
    - Instruction Stage
    - Configuration Stage
    - Algorithm Stage
  - Sound effects for mouse clicks and algorithm runs, creating an engaging game environment.

- **User-Friendly Interface**:
  - Interactive instruction page for new players
  - Configuration options for customizing the game grid and pathfinding settings

## Installation

1. **Clone the repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/ButasRafael/Visual_Search.git
   cd Visual_Search
2. **Install dependencies**:
   Make sure you have Python 3.7+ and Pygame installed:
    ```bash
   pip install pygame
3. **Run the game**:
    ```bash
   python main.py

## Usage
### Navigate the stages:
* Start at the instruction stage to learn the game controls and algorithm descriptions.
* Move to the configuration stage to set up the grid and other parameters.
* Select an algorithm to visualize and let the game show you the pathfinding process in action.
